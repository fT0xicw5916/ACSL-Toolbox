# ACSL-Toolbox
A comprehensive collection of Python scripts to assist you when preparing for the American Computer Science League (ACSL). Covers all topics.

## Prerequisites
Some python scripts may need to use third-party libraries. Install them with:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Catalog
* `bst.py`: Generate binary search trees (BSTs) based on input keys from command line.
* `eval_post.py`: Evaluates a postfix expression, assuming that there are no custom operators.
* `tips.txt`: Some handy python/algo tips you should be aware of. Basically a summary of the official [ACSL Wiki](https://www.acsl.org/get-started/study-materials).
