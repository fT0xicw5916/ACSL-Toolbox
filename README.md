# ACSL-Toolbox
A comprehensive collection of Python scripts to assist you when preparing for the American Computer Science League (ACSL). Covers all topics.

## Prerequisites
Some python scripts may need to use third-party libraries. Install them with:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Catalog

* `eval_pre.py`: Evaluates a prefix expression, assuming that there are no custom operators.
* `in2post.py`: Converts infix notation to postfix notation.
* `in2pre.py`: Converts infix notation to prefix notation.
* `max_heap.py`: Generates a max heap from given command line input.
* `min_heap.py`: Generates a min heap from given command line input.
* `post2in.py`: Converts postfix notation to infix notation.
* `regex.py`: Checks for regex matches.
* `tips.txt`: Some handy python/algo tips you should be aware of. Basically a summary of the official [ACSL Wiki](https://www.acsl.org/get-started/study-materials).
