# Computer Number Systems

To decimal: int("1010", <from_base>)
To binary: bin(123)[2:]
To octal: oct(123)[2:]
To hexadecimal: hex(123)[2:]

# Recursive Functions

Use Python!!!
sympy.isprime() for prime numbers

# What Does This Program Do?

Use Python!!!

/ is real division, not integer division

int() takes floor

for loop is inclusive on both ends

Arrays: A(5) for single-dimensional arrays and A(2, 3) for two-dimensional arrays
Starts at index 0 (Zero-based index)
Problems may start at 1
Size usually specified in problem statement

Strings: zero-based index
len(A) is same as Python
Use [] for slicing
S[:3] take first 3
S[4:] take last 4
S[2:6] take from index 2 to index 6 inclusive

# Prefix/Infix/Postfix Notation

Conversion/Evaluation scripts if no custom operators
Change input to a list if multiple digits for conversion scripts

# Boolean Algebra

Order of Precedence: NOT, AND, XOR & XNOR, OR

# Data Structures

Scripts for generating the images of min-heap, max-heap, binary search tree
Depth: Actual depth - 1 since the depth starts at 0
External node: A place where a new node could be attached
Internal path: Sum of the depths of all nodes
External path: Sum of the depths of all external nodes

# FSAs and Regular Expressions

Online: https://regex101.com/
Or use Python re library, template script exists (regex.py)

===

# Graph Theory

For adjacency matrices, use numpy (np.array(), np.dot())
For finding number of cycles, cycles.py

===

# Digital Electronics

Same as boolean algebra

# Assembly Language

GitHub repo: https://github.com/DavidGoldman/ACSLAssembly, I'm currently working on improvements at https://github.com/fT0xicw5916/ACSLAssembly (It is already good enough tho)
Interpreter: java aal.Driver
